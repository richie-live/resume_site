[{"content":"Introduction The objective of this paper is to plan a time-optimal attitude trajectory in a relatively short time for spacecraft with movable parts under complex pointing constraints. The constrained attitude planning problem is first established, then the constraints on attitude maneuvers are described. The time-optimal attitude planning for rigid spacecraft body is decoupled into geometric level and dynamic level through the addition of the path scalar. To obtain a given safe path in quaternion space, RRT*-Smart path planning and spherical and quadrangle (SQUAD) interpolation are carried out at the geometric level. The time-optimal parameterization for a given path is reformulated as a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem at the dynamic level through a nonlinear change in variables and the addition of various convexity-preserving extensions. In order to overcome the issue of high system dimension caused by the movable parts, a decoupled attitude planning method is designed to generate the quaternion trajectory of the spacecraft body and the rotation angle trajectory of the movable parts respectively. In comparison to GPOPS, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can plan a suboptimal solution in milliseconds. Furthermore, the performance indicator for energy consumption is better.\nSimulation Results ","date":"2023-08-01T03:49:15Z","image":"https://richie-live.github.io/p/time-optimal-attitude-planning-for-spacecraft-with-movable-parts-using-second-order-cone-programming/cover_hu1d8d10676ef48ae00c206d3a45c28afe_197656_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://richie-live.github.io/p/time-optimal-attitude-planning-for-spacecraft-with-movable-parts-using-second-order-cone-programming/","title":"Time-optimal Attitude Planning for Spacecraft with Movable Parts Using Second Order Cone Programming"},{"content":"Introduction The problem of attitude planning for spacecraft with movable parts under complex pointing constraints is addressed in this paper. To avoid tackling the complex pointing constraints in the high dimensional system, a novel decoupled strategy is proposed to map the pointing space to attitude space. Path planning algorithm RRT*-Smart is employed in pointing space to generate a collision-free pointing path and piecewise quintic polynomials are used to represent the attitude path. By proving the differential flatness of spacecraft with movable parts, the inverse dynamics is used to acquire attitude state trajectory in state space. Benefiting from the decoupled strategy, the attitude state trajectory is optimized by a new heuristic time allocation algorithm using binary search with no gradient information needed. The simulation results are discussed, and the performance during each scenario is analyzed.\nSimulation Results ","date":"2023-08-01T03:39:28Z","image":"https://richie-live.github.io/p/polynomial-attitude-trajectory-planning-for-spacecraft-with-movable-parts-using-decoupled-strategy/cover_hu24fba73505bdddca3893cf828cfc2014_394639_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://richie-live.github.io/p/polynomial-attitude-trajectory-planning-for-spacecraft-with-movable-parts-using-decoupled-strategy/","title":"Polynomial Attitude Trajectory Planning for Spacecraft with Movable Parts Using Decoupled Strategy"},{"content":"摘要 在引力波探测任务中，针对大尺度激光建链时目标姿态动态变化以及姿态机动约束复杂的问题，提出了引力波探测卫星动态姿态规划方法。首先给出引力波探测卫星的最优目标姿态求解方法。然后，设计了随机节点启发式扩展方法和目标姿态实时更新方法，对力矩轨迹进行平滑处理，实现了动态目标姿态规划。仿真结果表明，与经典RRT姿态规划方法相比，本文提出的方法具有更高的指向精度，并且消耗能量少，可满足引力波探测卫星大尺度建链保持的任务需求。\n仿真结果 使用经典RRT算法和改进RRT算法进行姿态规划，仿真结果如下：\n","date":"2023-08-01T03:27:51Z","image":"https://richie-live.github.io/p/%E4%B8%80%E7%A7%8D%E5%BC%95%E5%8A%9B%E6%B3%A2%E6%8E%A2%E6%B5%8B%E5%8D%AB%E6%98%9F%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%E5%A7%BF%E6%80%81%E8%A7%84%E5%88%92%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/cover_hu68b118913a43b54312d2c2fe24799f14_112651_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://richie-live.github.io/p/%E4%B8%80%E7%A7%8D%E5%BC%95%E5%8A%9B%E6%B3%A2%E6%8E%A2%E6%B5%8B%E5%8D%AB%E6%98%9F%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%E5%A7%BF%E6%80%81%E8%A7%84%E5%88%92%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/","title":"一种引力波探测卫星动态姿态规划方法"},{"content":"Welcome to Hugo theme Stack.
